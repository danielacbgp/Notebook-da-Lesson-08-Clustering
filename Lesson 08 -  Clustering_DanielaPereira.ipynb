These are both types of [supervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning). In supervised learning, you train an algorithm to predict an unknown variable from known variables.\n","\n","Another major type of machine learning is called [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). In unsupervised learning, we aren't trying to predict anything. Instead, we're finding patterns in data.\n","\n","One of the main unsupervised learning techniques is called **clustering**. We use clustering when we're trying to explore a dataset, and understand the connections between the various rows and columns. For example, we can cluster NBA players based on their statistics. Here's how such a clustering might look:\n","\n","<center><img width=\"600\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NUuctg1HZwvCQlFJTAYzsqgrhlDpi5VB\"></center>\n","\n","\n","**The clusters made it possible to discover player roles that might not have been noticed otherwise**.

There can be one or more groups in the data, and these groups form the clusters. As we look at the clusters, we can start to better understand the structure of the data.\n","\n","Clustering is a key way to explore unknown data, and it's a very commonly used machine learning technique.

Getting a bill passed by the Senate is a key step towards getting its provisions enacted. A **majority vote is required** to get a bill passed.\n","\n","The results of these votes, known as roll call votes, are public, and available in a few places, including [here](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress).

In the US, the 2 main political parties are the [Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party), who tend to be [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism), and the [Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party), who tend to be [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism). **Senators** can also choose to be unaffiliated with a party, and vote as **Independents**, although very few choose to do so.\n","\n","**114_congress.csv** contains all of the results of roll call votes from the **114th Senate**. Each row represents a single Senator, and each column represents a vote. A 0 in a cell means the Senator voted No on the bill, 1 means the Senator voted Yes, and 0.5 means the Senator abstained.\n","\n","Here are the relevant columns:\n","\n","- **name** -- The last name of the Senator.\n","- **party** -- the party of the Senator.

For instance, squaring [1,2,3] results in [1,4,9], and cubing it results in [1,8,27].\n","\n","We cube the distances so that we can get a good amount of separation between the extremists who are farther away from a party, who have distances that look like extremist = [3.4, .24], and moderates, whose distances look like moderate = [2.6, 2]. If we left the distances as is, we'd end up with 3.4 + .24 = 3.64, and 2.6 + 2 = 4.6, which would make the moderate, who is between both parties, seem extreme.

responsibility is to create scoring opportunities** for the team. We are going to focus our lesson on a machine learning technique called **clustering**, which allows us to visualize the types of point guards as well as group similar point guards together. **Using 2 features** allows us to easily visualize the players and will also make it easier to grasp how clustering works. For point guards, it's widely accepted that the **Assist to Turnover Ratio** is a good indicator for performance in games as it quantifies the number of scoring opportunities that player created. Let's also use **Points Per Game**, since effective Point Guards not only set up scoring opportunities but also take a lot of the shots themselves\n","\n","\n","<center><img width=\"300\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TRx73TAAQozxnflLXPhWXuDbM-Q2KHh4\"></center>\n","\n","\n","\n","**Exercise Start**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","- Create a new Dataframe which contains just the point guards from the data set.\n","  - Point guards are specified as **PG** in the **pos** column.\n","- Assign the filtered data frame to **point_guards**.\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"i6kWD5K24h7k","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":309},"outputId":"9a91911c-c4b1-45e6-d36e-64c742c771c6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1542218098208,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":761,"user":{"displayName":"Daniela Pereira","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OF33z70RcB8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAANvI/vTB3WV4yuUc/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"08675862579761211754"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# put your code here\n","point_guards = nba[nba['pos'] == 'PG'].copy()\n","point_guards.head(5)"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>player</th>\n","      <th>pos</th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>bref_team_id</th>\n","      <th>g</th>\n","      <th>gs</th>\n","      <th>mp</th>\n","      <th>fg</th>\n","      <th>fga</th>\n","      <th>fg.</th>\n","      <th>x3p</th>\n","      <th>x3pa</th>\n","      <th>x3p.</th>\n","      <th>x2p</th>\n","      <th>x2pa</th>\n","      <th>x2p.</th>\n","      <th>efg.</th>\n","      <th>ft</th>\n","      <th>fta</th>\n","      <th>ft.</th>\n","      <th>orb</th>\n","      <th>drb</th>\n","      <th>trb</th>\n","      <th>ast</th>\n","      <th>stl</th>\n","      <th>blk</th>\n","      <th>tov</th>\n","      <th>pf</th>\n","      <th>pts</th>\n","      <th>season</th>\n","      <th>season_end</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>24</th>\n","      <td>D.J.

The key part with K-Means (and most unsupervised machine learning techniques) is that we have to specify what k is. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, but one advantage is that we can pick the k that makes the most sense for our use case.
